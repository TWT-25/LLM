Creating a chatbot based on Dialogpt 

This is a group project completed in 2024 for the Break Through Tech AI UCLA program (https://samueli.ucla.edu/breakthroughtech-ai-losangeles-2/)
We worked with Ocelot AI (https://ocelot.ai/) on creating a chatbot from scratch for college student counseling.
I served as the group lead and main modeler on the team.
